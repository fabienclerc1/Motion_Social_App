# Motion React App Version 0.1

This app is a group project developped in one week during the Full-Stack Bootcamp at Propulsion Academy ZÃ¼rich.

The goal was to build a social network app where users can publish posts (text and images), comment, like and share other posts.
Users can also follow others people and send friend requests. It is then possible for them to sort posts based on the people they follow or by friends.

This app is developped with React.js, Redux, React Router, Styled Components, Axios and other packages.
Most components are functional component using React Hooks.

# Disclaimer

The current version is not complete and uploaded only to show the code developped and is not meant to run as it is now.
Missing features will be added in the coming weeks, until all is tested and working in combination with the backend API.
The backend API development is in progress and is not uploaded to Github yet.
